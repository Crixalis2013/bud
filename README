This is Bud, a.k.a. "Bloom Under Development".  It is an initial cut at
providing a Bloom-like language, using Ruby as a basis.

Language cheatsheet in doc/cheat.mdown

This 0.0 version is not supported.  

Main deficiencies at this point are:
- No Ruby constraints: Although the important Bud language features are
  available, the full power of Ruby is also available, including mutable state.
  This allows programmers to get outside the Bud framework and lose cleanliness.

- Inefficient evaluation: Programs are run using (semi-)naive evaluation strategies, no
  query optimization has been implemented, and little effort has been spent in
  tuning.

- No test harness.  Currently just Ruby's builtin test harness.  Need something
  better suited to Bud.

- Compatibility: Bud only works with Ruby (MRI) 1.8. MRI 1.9 and other Ruby
  implementations are currently not supported.

To install:
    % gem build bud.gemspec
    % sudo gem install bud-0.0.1.gem

To run the regression tests:
    % cd test; ruby ts_bud.rb

A "one-shot" shortest paths example:
    % ruby examples/other/paths.rb

To run a "ping-pong" example, see instructions in examples/other/pingpong.rb

Optional Dependencies
=====================

The bud gem depends on a handful of mandatory dependencies. It also has some
optional dependencies: if you wish to use the Bud collections backed by Tokyo
Cabinet or Zookeeper ("tctable" and "zktable" collection types, respectively),
the "tokyocabinet" and/or "zookeeper" gems must be installed.

Development Notes
=================

When installing an updated gem, using the "-l" option avoids querying the remote
RubyGems repository, and hence is significantly faster:

    % sudo gem install -l bud-0.0.1.gem
