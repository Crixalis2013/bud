Welcome to the documentation for *Bud*, a prototype of Bloom under development.

The documents here are organized to be read in any order, but you might like to try the following:

* [intro.md](intro.md): A brief introduction to Bud and Bloom
* [getstarted.md](getstarted.md): A quickstart to teach you basic Bloom concepts, the use of `rebl` interactive terminal, and the embedding of Bloom code in Ruby via the `Bud` module.
* [cheat.md](cheat.md): A concise "cheat sheet" to remind you about Bloom syntax.
