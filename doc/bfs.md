# BFS: A distributed filesystem in Bloom

In this document we'll use what we've learned to build a piece of systems software using Bloom.  
The libraries that ship with BUD provide many of the building blocks we'll need to create a distributed,
``chunked'' filesystem in the style of the Google Filesystem(GFS):
a [key-value store](https://github.com/bloom-lang/bud-sandbox/blob/master/kvs/kvs.rb), [nonce generation](https://github.com/bloom-lang/bud-sandbox/blob/master/ordering/nonce.rb), and a [heartbeat protocol](https://github.com/bloom-lang/bud-sandbox/blob/master/heartbeat/heartbeat.rb).
