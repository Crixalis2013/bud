#Bud: Bloom under development#
Welcome to the documentation for *Bud*, a prototype of Bloom under development.

The documents here are organized to be read in any order, but you might like to try the following:

* **[intro.md](intro.md)**: A brief introduction to Bud and Bloom.
* **getstarted.md**: A quickstart to teach you basic Bloom concepts, the use of
  `rebl` interactive terminal, and the embedding of Bloom code in Ruby via the
  `Bud` module.
* **operational.md**: an operational view of Bloom, to provide a more detailed
  model of how Bloom code is evaluated by Bud.
* **cheat.md**: A concise "cheat sheet" to remind you about Bloom syntax.
* **modules.md**: An overview of Bloom's modularity features.
* **ruby_hooks.md**: Bud module methods that allow you to interact with the Bud
  evaluator from other Ruby threads.
* **visualizations.md**: Overview of the `budvis` and `budplot` tools for
  visualizing Bloom program analyses.
* **bfs.md**:  A walkthrough of the Bloom distributed filesystem.

In addition, the **[bud-sandbox](http://github.com/bloom-lang/bud-sandbox)**
GitHub repository contains lots of useful libraries and example programs built
using Bloom.

Finally, the Bud gem ships with RubyDoc on the language constructs and runtime
hooks provided by the Bud module.  (To see rdoc, run `gem server` from a command
line and open [http://0.0.0.0:8808/](http://0.0.0.0:8808/))
