To run the bust twitter example client, do the following:

    # ruby bustclient-example.rb

To test out bust inspector, do the following:

    # ruby bustserver-example.rb

Then, launch bustinspector.html in a web browser (only Firefox 4 has been tested thus far) on either the computer where you launched bustserver-example.rb, or any computer that has TCP port 8080 forwarded to the computer where you launched bustserver-example.rb.
