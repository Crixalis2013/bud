# The root Bud module. To cause an instance of Bud to begin executing, there are
# three main options:
#
# 1. Synchronously. To do this, instantiate your program and then call tick()
#    one or more times; each call evaluates a single Bud timestep. In this mode,
#    any network messages or timer events that occur will be buffered until the
#    next call to tick(). This is mostly intended for "one-shot" programs that
#    compute a single result and then terminate, or for interactively
#    "single-stepping" through the execution of an event-driven system.
# 2. In a separate thread in the foreground. To do this, instantiate your
#    program and then call run_fg(). The Bud interpreter will then run, handling
#    network events and evaluating new timesteps as appropriate. The run_fg()
#    method will not return unless an error occurs.
# 3. In a separate thread in the background. To do this, instantiate your
#    program and then call run_bg(). The Bud interpreter will run
#    asynchronously. To interact with Bud (e.g., insert additional data or
#    inspect the state of a Bud collection), use the sync_do and async_do
#    methods.
#
# Most programs should use method #3. Note that in all three cases, the stop()
# method should be used to shutdown a Bud instance and release any resources it
# is using.

    #   @new_delta: a place to store newly-derived facts
    #
    # The first time through this loop we mark @stratum_first_iter=true, which
    # tells the Join::each code to join up all its @storage subcollections to
    # start. In subsequent iterations the join code uses some table's @delta to
    # ensure that only new tuples are derived.

    # Note that calling "each" on a non-Join collection will iterate through
    # both storage and delta.

    # - @delta tuples are merged into @storage
    # - @new_delta tuples are moved into @delta
    # - @new_delta is set to empty

    # XXX as a performance optimization, it would be nice to bypass the delta
    # tables for any preds that don't participate in a rhs Join -- in that case
    # there's pointless extra tuple movement letting tuples "graduate" through
    # @new_delta and @delta.
