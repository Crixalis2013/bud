# The root Bud module. To run a Bud instance, there are three main options:
#
# 1. Synchronously. To do this, instantiate your program and then call tick()
#    one or more times; each call evaluates a single Bud timestep. Note that in
#    this mode, network communication (channels) and timers cannot be used. This
#    is mostly intended for "one-shot" programs that compute a single result and
#    then terminate.
# 2. In a separate thread in the foreground. To do this, instantiate your
#    program and then call run(). The Bud interpreter will then run, handling
#    network events and evaluating new timesteps as appropriate. The run()
#    method will not return unless an error occurs.
# 3. In a separate thread in the background. To do this, instantiate your
#    program and then call run_bg(). The Bud interpreter will run
#    asynchronously. To interact with Bud (e.g., insert additional data or
#    inspect the state of a Bud collection), use the sync_do and async_do
#    methods. To shutdown the Bud interpreter, use stop_bg().
#
# Most programs should use method #3.
