    #  of tuples within a collection.)

    # the diff between storage and delta.
    # But calling map on a non-join collection goes through both
    # storage and delta.

    # XXX
    # To use deltas for all Collections (not just Join), we would
    # need Collection.each to understand that on iteration 1 of a
    # fixpoint, it should use storage for all predicates, but
    # on iterations 2..n of a fixpoint, it should use
    # deltas for predicates that appear in lhs in this stratum,
    # and use storage for predicates that appear in lower strata.
    # XXX
    # another performance optimization would be to bypass the delta
    # tables for any preds that don't participate in an rhs -- in that
    # case the deltas just end up requiring pointless extra tuple movement
