    # - delta tuples move into storage
    # - new_delta moves to delta
    # - new_delta is set to empty
    # (see BudCollection for a description of the 4 partitions 
    #  of tuples within a collection.)
    # This scheme does semi-naive eval for Join.map
    # because the join.each code understands
    # the diff between storage and delta.
    # But calling map on a non-join collection goes through both
    # storage and delta.

    # XXX
    # To use deltas for all Collections (not just Join), we would
    # need Collection.each to understand that on iteration 1 of a 
    # fixpoint, it should use storage for all predicates, but
    # on iterations 2..n of a fixpoint, it should use
    # deltas for predicates that appear in lhs in this stratum,
    # and use storage for predicates that appear in lower strata.
    # XXX
    # another performance optimization would be to bypass the delta 
    # tables for any preds that don't participate in an rhs -- in that
    # case the deltas just end up requiring pointless extra tuple movement
